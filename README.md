Until 1.3, turrets would happily attack escaping prisoners. Something in 1.3 changed that. This mod makes it so that turrets will consider escaping prisoners, rebelling slaves, or "panic-fleeing" pawns as valid targets.

I spent much more time writing this than testing it, but it seems to work on escaping prisoners at least. Enjoy.
