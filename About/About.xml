  <description>Until 1.3, turrets would happily attack escaping prisoners. Something in 1.3 changed that. This mod makes it so that any turret will consider any escaping prisoner, rebelling slave, or "panic-fleeing" pawn as a valid target.

I spent much more time writing this than testing it, but it seems to work. Enjoy.</description>
